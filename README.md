# HiContactCaller

Latest version of the contact caller should be updated here!


Dependencies:
Python2.7


NOTE! 
All files including the bash and python files, baits, preys and contact files should be on the SAME directory.
Currently, the baits, preys and contact files should be splitted by chromosome and chromosomes the contact caller should be ran with each chromosoe seperatly. This was done to save time by analyzing chromosomes in parallel.
