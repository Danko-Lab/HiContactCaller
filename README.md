# HiContactCaller

Latest version of the contact caller should be updated here!


Dependencies:
Python2.7


NOTE! 
All files including the bash and python files, baits, preys and contact files should be on the SAME directory.
Corrently, the baits, preys and contact files should be splitted by chromosome - this was done so that chromosomes could be analyzed in parallel.
